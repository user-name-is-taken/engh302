\section{Introduction}

Every programmer is ordained into the church of code with the same program. It's a simple program. All it does is print the words 'hello world' out. In 2014, I took a computer science class, printed 'hello world', and am now forever a member of the church of code. When I wrote my first 'hello world' program in 2014, I was already 21. 21 is old for a programmer to write their first 'hello world', being nearly a man when I first learned to code has given me a unique perspective on what life is like with and without programming and how fun it truly is. In this essay I will explain: the problems I had before I knew how to program, how much fun I had learning how to solve those problems, and how I currently program with a team of other expert programmers. Throughout this class and in my internship at Leidos this summer, I intend to further research tools that enable team work between developers. I hope to have another 'hello world' moment with some of these tools, and perhaps introduce some of them to my team!
