## writing experience

### Sub-prompt

What kinds of research and writing have you done in your major? (Have you taken/are you currently taking a research methods or writing-intensive class? Have you done/are you doing an undergraduate research project or capstone project? Have you had an internship, clinical experience, or other work experience related to your major?)

### Response

My writing experience in the information technology major includes:
  - Writing a 15 page research paper in an Operating systems class
  - Writing a 10 page analysis of a project in my project management class
  - I've had an internship related to Information technology where I wrote Java, C++, and Python code to develop a phone tracking system.

## Interests/Frustrations with Writing in IT

### Sub-prompt

What interests you or frustrates you most about research/writing in your major?

### Response

#### Interests

Writing research papers in information technology brings a unique perspective. The information technology major is mostly geared toward teaching skills related to information technology which includes writing papers, but it's not very common. In highschool I took an AP English which permanently shaped the way I write and think. Applying this experience to information technology often feels alien because the prompts in AP English were opinion based and broad, while the prompts in information technology are the exact opposite.

#### Frustrations

The alien perspective discussed above is a double edged sword. I can't write as quickly and fluidly as I can when I'm expressing a broad opinion.

## Future use of writing experience from 302

### Sub-prompt

How could you use the assignments in this class to reflect and build on past/ongoing projects?  (Is there a possibility that you could take advantage of the dual submission option?)

## Response

I hope to use the assignments in this class to document my experience and research at my internship this summer. I'm taking another class this summer which I believe is writing intensive. I don't intend on using dual submission because I doubt I can use my internship experience to write an assignment for the other writing intensive class. Also, my other class is a B session class so I'm not entirely sure what the assignments are in the class yet. I may contact you next week regarding dual submission if I have to write a paper in the other class.

## Databases experience

### Sub-prompt

How familiar are you with resources in your major and in your department?

### Response

In my Operating Systems paper I scheduled an appointment with a librarian who introduced me to many of the databases we use in the major. Still, the best tool is Google and Google Scholar. I usually find resources that are copyrighted on Google and Google Scholar, which I then get for free through https://library.gmu.edu/

## Opinion

### Sub-prompt

What kinds of college writing assignments have you found most interesting or most difficult?

### Response

I find longer papers harder and therefore more instructive because staying on point becomes more difficult as the size of the paper increases. These long papers make me appreciate authors more.
