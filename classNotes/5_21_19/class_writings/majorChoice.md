When did you choose or declare your major? What first drew you to this major? What do you like best about it?

I choose to declare my major after taking a computer science class on a whim and got hooked. I knew I didn't want to do the math because I've been traumatized by evil math teachers in the past so I choose Information Technology instead of Computer Science.

Do you think that your decision was shaped more by your formal education or by experiences outside the classroom, including any attempts you made to educate yourself?

### response

My decision was shaped by my experiences in the classroom, but I wouldn't have had those experiences if I stuck to the path that was laid out for me by the education system. As with anything, if you choose to be in a classroom, you'll enjoy it, but if you're forced to be in the class, you'll hate it.
